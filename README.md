# MusicRater
project for rate the music overall
is a web application developed on the Flask web framework, which was used to create the server part in Python. the code is built using OOP, or more precisely, using methods that make it easy to scale and support the application. the frontend is implemented using HTML and CSS. a combination of SQLAlchemy and PostgreSQL is used to manage data: the first provides ORM for working with the database, and the second acts as the database itself. to check the validity of the data, C# code is used, using libraries for working with PostgreSQL. all this is implemented through the subprocess module in Python.
